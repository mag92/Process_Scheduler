# Process_Scheduler

This is a project made in Java that is split into a server and a client. 

The client sends all details about processes/tasks to the sever, the server computes turnaround time and other details about the processes according to the following scheduling policies:

1) FCFS
2) SJF Preemptive
3) SJF Non-preemptive
4) Priority-based preemptive
5) Priority-based non-preemptive
6) Multilevel Queue (SJF preemptive - FCFS)

More to be added to the README.
